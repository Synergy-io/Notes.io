- ==Records in a MongoDB database are called documents==
- You can still have multiple groups of data too. In MongoDB, instead of ==tables these are called collections.==

### Mongo Query API

- The MongoDB Query API can be used in two ways:
	- CRUD Operations
	- Aggregation Pipelines

- To see all available databases, in your terminal type `show dbs`.
- An empty database is essentially non-existant.
- You can change or create a new database by typing `use` then the name of the database.
