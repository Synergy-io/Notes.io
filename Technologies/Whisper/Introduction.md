# Whisper AI

## üìå What is Whisper?
Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model developed by OpenAI. It can transcribe speech in multiple languages and even handle noisy environments. Whisper is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio sources, making it robust across a wide range of audio conditions, such as varying accents, background noise, and different languages.

## üìö Quick Overview:

- Multilingual Support
  
- Accurate Transcriptions

- Automatic Language Detection

- Robust in Noisy Backgrounds

## üß† Key Features:

- **Speech-to-Text**

- **Multiple Accents and Dialects**:
  
- **Open Source**

- **Streaming Support**

## üß© Use Cases:

- **Transcription of Audio/Video**

- **Translation and Localization**

- **Speech Analytics**

- **Accessibility**

## üí° How Does Whisper Work?

1. **Input**: You feed the audio data (like speech or conversation) into the model.
  
2. **Processing**: The model processes the audio using a series of neural network layers optimized for speech recognition, converting the speech into a spectrogram (visual representation of sound).
  
3. **Output**: Whisper outputs the transcribed text, and it can also include detected language information.

4. **Fine-tuning**: The Whisper model is pre-trained on a large dataset and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as recognizing a particular dialect or type of background noise.

## üìä Model Sizes:

- **Tiny**: ~75 MB (Fast but less accurate)
- **Base**: ~150 MB (Balance of speed and accuracy)
- **Small**: ~300 MB (Improved accuracy)
- **Medium**: ~1.5 GB (Higher accuracy, requires more resources)
- **Large**: ~5.5 GB (Most accurate, requires significant resources)

## üîß How to Use Whisper:

```python
import whisper

# Load the model (choose 'base', 'small', 'medium', or 'large')
model = whisper.load_model("base")

# Load the audio file
audio = whisper.load_audio("path/to/audiofile.mp3")

# Preprocess the audio (pad/trimming)
audio = whisper.pad_or_trim(audio)

# Convert the audio into a log-Mel spectrogram
mel = whisper.log_mel_spectrogram(audio).to(model.device)

# Transcribe the audio
result = model.transcribe("path/to/audiofile.mp3")

# Print the transcribed text
print(result["text"])
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
```
It also requires the command-line tool ffmpeg to be installed on your system, which is available from most package managers:

```bash
# on Ubuntu or Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

# on Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg

# on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
brew install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/)
choco install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/)
scoop install ffmpeg
```
