# CSRF Token in Spring Security

## Login Process and Session ID

When a user logs in:
1. The **login credentials** (username and password) are sent to the server.
2. The server **authenticates** the user.
3. If authentication is successful, the server creates a **session** for the user and assigns a **Session ID**.
4. This **Session ID** is stored in a cookie and sent with subsequent requests to maintain user authentication.

## What is a CSRF Token?
CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is an attack where an unauthorized command is executed on behalf of an authenticated user. To prevent this, **CSRF tokens** are used.

- A **CSRF token** is a randomly generated value assigned to a user session.
- It ensures that requests to modify data (like form submissions) come from an authenticated source.
- Each request requiring authentication should include this token.


### Why Do Some HTTP Requests Work Without a CSRF Token?
- **GET requests** (fetching data) usually do not require a CSRF token since they do not modify state.
- Some APIs may be **CSRF-exempt** based on security configurations.
- If CSRF protection is **disabled** in Spring Security, requests can be made without the token.


### CSRF Token Key and Retrieval
- The key used for CSRF tokens in headers is: **`X-CSRF-TOKEN`**.
- To retrieve the CSRF token in Spring Boot, use the following endpoint:


```java
@GetMapping("/csrf-token")
public CsrfToken csrf(HttpServletRequest request) {
    return (CsrfToken) request.getAttribute("_csrf");
}
```

This endpoint returns the CSRF token, which can be included in subsequent requests for authentication.
