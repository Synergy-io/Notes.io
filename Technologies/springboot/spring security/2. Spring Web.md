# Spring Web and Sessions

### Spring Web: Servlet and Reactive
Spring Web comes in two main models:
1. **Servlet-based (Spring MVC):** Works with traditional servlet containers like Tomcat.
2. **Reactive (Spring WebFlux):** Designed for asynchronous and non-blocking applications.

Spring Boot, by default, runs on a **servlet container** (like **Tomcat**) and follows the servlet-based model, allowing easy deployment of Spring MVC applications.

### Filters in Spring Boot
Spring Security and other frameworks use **filters** to intercept requests before they reach controllers. Some common filters include:
- **Authentication Filter:** Handles login authentication.
- **CORS Filter:** Manages cross-origin requests.
- **Logging Filter:** Logs requests and responses.

Example of a custom filter:
```java
@Component
public class CustomFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {
    @Override
    protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain filterChain)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        System.out.println("Request URL: " + request.getRequestURI());
        filterChain.doFilter(request, response);
    }
}
```

### What is a Session ID?
A **Session ID** is a unique identifier assigned to a user session by the server. It helps track user activity across multiple requests in a session.

### How to Check Session ID
To view the **Session ID** in the browser:
1. Open Developer Tools (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
2. Go to the **Application** tab.
3. Navigate to **Cookies** under **Storage**.
4. Find `JSESSIONID` under the siteâ€™s cookies.

### When Does the Session ID Change?
- The **Session ID changes** on each new login.
- If a user logs out and logs back in, a new session is created with a different ID.
- If a session expires, a new ID is generated upon the next request.

### Printing the Session ID to Console
To print the session ID in a Spring Boot application:
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/session")
public class SessionController {
    @GetMapping("/id")
    public String getSessionId(HttpServletRequest request) {
        String sessionId = request.getSession().getId();
        System.out.println("Session ID: " + sessionId);
        return sessionId;
    }
}
```
This endpoint prints and returns the session ID when accessed.
